### Before starting, you need to know some <mark style="color:red;">terms</mark>:

#### _<mark style="color:red;">Plaintext:</mark>_&#x20;

Plaintext refers to the original, unencrypted, and easily readable data or message. It is the information that you want to protect or transmit securely. In the context of cryptography, plaintext is the input data before it is transformed into a secure form.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">Ciphertext:</mark>_

Ciphertext is the result of applying encryption to the plaintext. It is the encrypted or encoded form of the original message, which is intended to be unintelligible to anyone without the proper decryption key or algorithm. Ciphertext is used to protect the confidentiality of data during transmission or storage.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">Encryption:</mark>_

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a specific algorithm and an encryption key. The purpose of encryption is to make the original data unreadable to unauthorized parties. It is a fundamental technique in cybersecurity and information security for safeguarding sensitive information.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">Decryption:</mark>_

Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It involves converting ciphertext back into plaintext, typically using a decryption key or algorithm. Decryption is performed by authorized individuals or systems to retrieve the original, understandable information from the encrypted data.
